# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Welcome to My Fabulous Day!
Your 9 to 5, Simplified.

This simple work day calendar application allows the fabulous user (that's you!) to save appointments and events for every hour of the day. 
This App runs in browser on dynamically updaed HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
Using the Moment.js library enables easy use of current date and time. 
Using pastels, we make it easy on the eyes!
